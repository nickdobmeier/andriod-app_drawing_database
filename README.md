# andriod app - drawing database

User can use finger to make drawing on screen ("ink" follows users finger). The user can draw lines of multiple different colors, sizes, and an UNDO button is present that allows the user to backtrack each succesive line (between which the user lifted finger off-screen).

Each drawing can be saved (using an internal & onboard SQLite Database), and then opened/modifed on later runs of the app.
